In this talk, we will first look at how to code split on Component level, and then look at how Angular Loadable makes it simpler and adds tons of features required for component level code splitting.

Alex Eagle is on the Angular core\nteam at Google and has been doing a lot of work to make sure Angular 2 works\nwell with TypeScript. Blake Embrey is the creator of ts-node and a huge\nTypeScript enthusiast.
